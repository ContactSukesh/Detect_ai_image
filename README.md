# AI Image Detective üîç

- **Export Functionality**: Download detection reports in CSV or JSON format

### üî¨ Advanced Features
- **GradCAM Heatmaps**: Visual representation showing which image regions influenced the AI detection
- **Confidence Scoring**: Detailed probability metrics for predictions
- **Model Comparison**: See individual results from each model in ensemble mode
- **Historical Analytics**: View statistics and trends across all detections

1. Select "Single Image" mode
2. Optionally enable "Use Ensemble Detection" for multi-model analysis
3. Upload an image (PNG, JPEG, or WebP)
4. Click "Analyze Image"
5. View results including:
   - Prediction (AI-Generated or Real)
   - Confidence score
   - Detection heatmap (showing influential regions)
   - Detailed analysis metrics

#### 2. Batch Processing Mode
1. Select "Batch Processing" mode
2. Upload multiple images at once
3. Click "Analyze All Images"
4. View summary statistics and individual results for each image

#### 3. History Mode
1. Select "History" mode
2. View all past detections with statistics
3. Export history to CSV or JSON format
4. Clear history if needed

## Technical Details

### Model Architecture

#### Single Model Detection
- **Base Architecture**: ResNet-50 with custom classification head
- **Input Resolution**: 224√ó224 pixels
- **Preprocessing**: ImageNet normalization
- **Output**: Binary classification (Real vs AI-Generated)

#### Ensemble Detection
- **Models Used**:
  - ResNet-50: Deep residual network with 50 layers
  - ResNet-34: Lighter residual network with 34 layers
  - MobileNetV2: Efficient mobile architecture
- **Ensemble Method**: Majority voting with confidence averaging
- **Improved Accuracy**: Multiple perspectives reduce false positives

### Heatmap Visualization
- **Technique**: GradCAM (Gradient-weighted Class Activation Mapping)
- **Purpose**: Shows which image regions contributed most to the detection
- **Visualization**: Red/yellow areas indicate high influence on AI detection

### Database Schema

```sql
CREATE TABLE detection_history (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    filename VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
    prediction INTEGER NOT NULL,
    confidence FLOAT NOT NULL,
    is_ensemble BOOLEAN DEFAULT FALSE,
    ensemble_details TEXT,
    timestamp TIMESTAMP DEFAULT CURRENT_TIMESTAMP,
    image_size VARCHAR(50),
    file_format VARCHAR(20)
);
```

## File Structure

```
.
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ app.py                  # Main Streamlit application
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ model.py               # AI detection models (Single & Ensemble)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ database.py            # Database management and history tracking
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ utils.py               # Image preprocessing utilities
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ .streamlit/
‚îÇ   ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ config.toml        # Streamlit configuration
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ README.md             # This file
```

## Supported Image Formats

- JPEG (.jpg, .jpeg)
- PNG (.png)
- WebP (.webp)

## Configuration

### Streamlit Configuration (`.streamlit/config.toml`)
```toml
[server]
headless = true
address = "0.0.0.0"
port = 5000
```

## Export Formats

### CSV Export
Includes columns:
- ID, Filename, Prediction, Confidence (%), Method, Image Size, Format, Timestamp

### JSON Export
Structured JSON with:
- All detection metadata
- Ensemble model details (if applicable)
- ISO formatted timestamps

## Performance

- **Single Model Processing**: ~2.5 seconds per image
- **Ensemble Processing**: ~3.5 seconds per image
- **Batch Processing**: Processes images sequentially with progress tracking
- **GPU Support**: Automatically uses CUDA if available, falls back to CPU

## How It Works

1. **Image Upload**: User uploads image through web interface
2. **Preprocessing**: Image is resized to 224√ó224 and normalized
3. **Model Inference**: 
   - Single model: ResNet-50 analyzes the image
   - Ensemble: 3 models vote on the prediction
4. **Heatmap Generation**: GradCAM creates visual attention map (single model only)
5. **Result Display**: Prediction, confidence, and visualization shown to user
6. **Database Storage**: Detection saved to history for future reference

## Detection Accuracy

The model looks for common AI generation artifacts:
- Over-smoothness in textures
- Unusual color distributions
- Perfect symmetries
- Other learned patterns specific to AI-generated content

**Note**: This tool provides probabilistic predictions and should be used as a reference rather than definitive proof.

## Database Management

### View History
Access through "History" mode to see:
- Total detections
- AI-generated vs Real statistics
- Ensemble usage count
- Individual detection details

### Export Data
- Download CSV for spreadsheet analysis
- Download JSON for programmatic processing
- Includes up to 10,000 most recent detections

### Clear History
- One-click deletion of all detection records
- Irreversible action - use with caution

## Troubleshooting

### Model Loading Issues
- Ensure sufficient memory (ResNet-50 requires ~100MB)
- Check internet connection for downloading pretrained weights

### Database Connection Errors
- Verify DATABASE_URL environment variable is set
- Check PostgreSQL service is running

### Image Upload Failures
- Ensure image is in supported format (PNG, JPEG, WebP)
- Check file size is reasonable (<10MB recommended)
- Verify image dimensions are between 32√ó32 and 4000√ó4000 pixels
